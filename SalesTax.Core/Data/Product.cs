// Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt. 
// Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.
// When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes paid. 
// The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.
